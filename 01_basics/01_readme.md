#1 const keyword value can't be changed after declaration. But var and let value's can.

#2 If we do not write variable keyword like "let" or "var" then we can decalre the varibales as well as shown below:
    acb = 123; // Not recommended
    console.log(abc)
    output: 123

#3 Prefer not to use "var" because of issue in block and functional scope. Use only let and const
